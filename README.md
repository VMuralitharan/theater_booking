**CineGo** is a modern movie ticket booking website designed to provide users with a seamless cinema experience. The platform allows moviegoers to browse available films, select showtimes, choose their preferred theater, and pick seats through an interactive seat map. After selecting their seats, users are directed to a secure payment page where they can complete their purchase. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, CineGo features a responsive design, real-time seat availability indicators, and session storage for smooth navigation between booking steps. This project demonstrates core frontend development concepts while simulating a real-world e-commerce flow for ticket purchases.
